A showcase website may take 3-4 weeks, while more complex projects with advanced features can take 2-3 months or more. I'll always provide you with a clear timeline at the start of the project. You can see examples of completed work in the <a href='/#projects' class='text-sky-600 hover:underline dark:text-sky-400'>Projects</a> section."

        answer: 'I specialize in creating websites with <a href="https://squarespace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline dark:text-sky-400">Squarespace</a> and <a href="https://framer.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-sky-600 hover:underline dark:text-sky-400">Framer</a>, both excellent for modern design and simple content management. I can also develop fully custom-coded websites for specific needs, though this requires more time and a higher budget.'
