        answer: "Development time varies depending on the complexity of the project. A showcase website may take 3-4 weeks, while more complex projects with advanced features can take 2-3 months or more. I'll always provide you with a clear timeline at the start of the project. You can see examples of completed work in the <a href='/#projects' aria-label='Go to projects section' class='text-sky-600 hover:underline dark:text-sky-400'>Projects</a> section."
